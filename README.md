# SEAtoPDX
I'm moving to Portland, OR in January! 
I've gotten a whole range of reactions, but most importantly, I've gotten a lot of jokes, jabs, and advice about moving from Seattle. In the spirit of sharing this with the world (and having a reference for when I actually move), please chime in!

## Jokes, Jabs, Warnings (?)
_Laughter is medicine and life's too short to take things too seriously_
* Here’s a tip for you when speaking to the locals:

  Vancouver = Vancouver, British Columbia, ‘The Couve’ = Vancouver, Washington
  
* Have you watched [Portlandia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1780441/) TV show? Check if out so you are ready for Portland

## Food 
_If I had to pick a deadly sin, it'd have to be be gluttony_
* [Teardrop Cocktail Lounge](https://www.yelp.com/biz/teardrop-cocktail-lounge-portland?adjust_creative=bing&utm_campaign=yelp_feed&utm_medium=feed_v2&utm_source=bing)
* If you ever see Carte Blanche open again go there!  http://www.carteblanchefoodcart.com/
* SakéOne Brewery - to get sake by the growler
* [Jake's Famous Crawfish](http://www.mccormickandschmicks.com/locations/portland-oregon/portland-oregon/sw12thave.aspx) One of the best seafood restaurant there

## Adventure 
_Because I probably have to fill time between eating and working_
* Pittock mansion is fun
* Living Room Theater is fun
