# SEAtoPDX
I'm moving to Portland, OR in January! 
I've gotten a whole range of reactions, but most importantly, I've gotten a lot of jokes, jabs, and advice about moving from Seattle. In the spirit of sharing this with the world (and having a reference for when I actually move), please chime in!

## Jokes, Jabs, Warnings (?)
_Laughter is medicine and life's too short to take things too seriously_
* Starter bullet point!

## Food 
_If I had to pick a deadly sin, it'd have to be be gluttony_
* Starter bullet point!

## Adventure 
_Because I probably have to fill time between eating and working_
* Starter bullet point!
